text="""Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to comprehend, generate, and manipulate human language.
Natural language processing has the ability to interrogate the data with natural language text or voice.
This is also called “language in.” Most consumers have probably interacted with NLP without realizing it.
For instance, NLP is the core technology behind virtual assistants, such as the Oracle Digital Assistant (ODA), Siri, Cortana, or Alexa.
When we ask questions of these virtual assistants, NLP is what enables them to not only understand the user’s request, but to also respond in natural language.
NLP applies both to written text and speech, and can be applied to all human languages.
Other examples of tools powered by NLP include web search, email spam filtering, automatic translation of text or speech, document summarization, sentiment analysis, and grammar/spell checking.
